                  Prospective authors from India are invited to submit
                  manuscripts reporting original, unpublished research and
                  recent developments in the topics related to the conference.
                  Submissions must include title, abstract, author affiliation
                  with the email address and keywords as per template which is
                  available in the website. The paper should not contain page

                  Regular papers should present novel perspectives within the
                  general scope of the conference. Short papers
                  (Work-in-Progress) are an opportunity to present preliminary
                  or interim results. The paper length should be in{" "}

                  Literature reviews/survey papers will only be considered if
                  they present a new perspective or benefit the field. To be
                  published, such papers must go beyond a review of the
                  literature to define the field in a new way or highlight
                  exciting new technologies or areas of research.
